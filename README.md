#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline focused on the systematic development of high-quality software products using engineering principles, methods, and tools.
The importance: Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solutions that meet user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Agile Methodology (2001):

Milestone: The publication of the Agile Manifesto.
Description: Agile introduced iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility in software projects, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changes and deliver software more efficiently.
2. 1960s: The term "Software Engineering is coined"
3.Introduction of DevOps (Late 2000s):

Milestone: The rise of DevOps as a practice combining software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
Description: DevOps promotes continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), automating the deployment process and fostering collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to faster and more reliable software releases.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation.
Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. 
Agile promotes ongoing collaboration.
While Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages
Agile Scenario in the Health Sector:
Developing a Telemedicine App:

Scenario: A healthcare startup is developing a telemedicine app that allows patients to consult with doctors online. The app needs to be continuously updated based on user feedback, new medical guidelines, and emerging technologies such as wearable device integration.
Why Agile? The dynamic nature of the project, where user feedback and market demands are constantly evolving, makes Agile the ideal approach. Agile allows the development team to release new features in iterations, respond to user feedback quickly, and adapt to changes in medical practices or technology, ensuring the app stays relevant and effective for patients and doctors.

Waterfall Scenario in the Health Sector:
Developing an Electronic Health Record (EHR) System:

Scenario: A hospital is implementing a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system that must comply with strict healthcare regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). The system requires thorough documentation, stringent security measures, and precise integration with existing hospital infrastructure.
Why Waterfall? The project demands a detailed and structured approach due to the critical nature of patient data, regulatory compliance, and the need for extensive testing before deployment. The Waterfall model ensures that each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing) is completed with high accuracy, leaving little room for error or change once development begins.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs streamline development by providing tools for writing, debugging, and managing code in one place, increasing efficiency and reducing errors. Example Vscode
VCSs manage code changes, support collaboration, and provide version history, ensuring that developers can work together effectively and recover from mistakes. Example Git/Github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements: Requirements might change during the development cycle, causing scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: The pressure to produce software solutions on time can lead to hasty development and reduced quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accumulated through shortcuts or inadequate solutions, technical debt can stymie future development attempts and raise maintenance expenses.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of AI models. It helps in shaping interactions to be more accurate, relevant, and aligned with user needs, ultimately enhancing the overall functionality and usability of AI systems.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about diabetes."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, including their causes, symptoms, and treatment options."
Improved is more effective because it of its Specificity and clarity
